# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  
# Approach 
A URL for GeoJSON earthquake data was used from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then the data added to a map. JavaScript and the D3.js library was used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the eathquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then the Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
Please note that this project was completed in stages. A ne logic.js file was created for each stage with the file file with the completed project being saved as challenge_logic2.js.
